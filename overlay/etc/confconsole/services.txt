Welcome to MineOS.  You can access the web user interface through HTTPS on port 8443.  SSH is also enabled on the default port 22.

MineOS Web-Ui: https://$ipaddr:8443
SSH/SFTP:   mc@$ipaddr (port 22)

Root SSH/SFTP login is disabled by default but can be enabled through /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Please note, out of the box, only ports 22, 8443, & 25565 (default Minecraft port) are open. Servers and services that run on any other ports must be opened in the iptables firewall manually, e.g., 80, 25570.
